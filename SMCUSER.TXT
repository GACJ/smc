1.	Introduction

Single Method Composer (SMC) has been developed to carry out exhaustive searches for 
compositions of treble-hunting Major methods. It can search for short touches, quarterpeal 
compositions, peal compositions, or even extents.

The program is written entirely in 80386 assembler and has been designed to achieve the 
highest possible composing speed. With the Pentium microprocessors currently available 
it can generate and check over half a million leads per second. Even at this speed many 
searches are still too long to exhaust. Consequently a number of different types of 
selection criteria can be specified to restrict the search. Some of these criteria can be used 
to optimise the composing table, some to optimise the composing process, and some to 
evaluate the compositions found. The earlier the selection criteria can be applied the more 
effectively the search can be contained.

One of the benefits of using this brute force approach to composition is that if an 
exhaustive search can be completed, it is possible to assess what is the best available 
composition for the specified criteria. Comparison with existing collections can also show 
where an interesting composition has been missed using traditional methods.

SMC comes into its own when used for methods with a high incidence of falseness. To 
find compositions for such methods by hand is slower than for methods with little 
incidence of falseness; but for SMC the greater the falseness, the faster the search can be 
completed. This is because the falseness chops off huge branches of the search tree and 
this outweighs the additional time required to check the higher number of false lead heads.

For many methods, huge numbers of compositions exist. The job of the composer is then 
one of selecting those which have some different, improved or special quality over those 
previously produced. SMC provides a summary of musical rows and scores compositions 
found to assist this process.   

Some insight into method structure, incidence of falseness and composing techniques will 
help to decide how best to restrict a particular search. However, some exploratory 
searches using different criteria can often indicate what might work. For example, if too 
many compositions are being found, the search criteria can be tightened. Conversely, if no 
compositions are being found then the criteria can be relaxed. Furthermore, there is an 
option to exclude tenors split course heads, which is very effective in finding alternative 
course structures.

I don't mind users of SMC claiming authorship of any new compositions discovered  
(provided that someone else hasn't found and submitted them for publication first), but if 
you intend to publish in the Ringing World, please be careful not to waste the Peal 
Compositions Committee's time by:

*	using an independent peal proving program to confirm it is true 

*	being as sure as you can that it, or something very similar, has not been published 
	before

*	comparing it with published compositions to ensure that it has a distinction making it 
	worthy of publication

*	pointing out why you think the composition has merit

*	not submitting lots of variants of a composition

2.	System Requirements

SMC is an MS-DOS program which requires a PC with an 80386 or better processor and 
at least 584K (600,000 bytes) of conventional memory available to execute it. It displays 
80x25 text, so there are no special display requirements.

If it is difficult to make sufficient memory available under your normal configuration, 
create a bootable diskette for SMC where DOS and the essential drivers are loaded in high 
memory.

SMC can also be run under Windows if the conventional memory requirement can be met. 
This has the big advantage that it can be left running in the background for long periods 
without tying up the PC.

The program can be run by executing SMC.EXE and no data files are required. To run 
under Windows, a program information file (SMC.PIF) and Windows Icon (SMC.ICO) 
are also provided, but are not essential.

3.	SMC Functions

All SMC functions can be invoked at any time, regardless of the function last invoked. No 
confirmation (are you sure?) messages are issued by SMC, so care should be taken to 
ensure the correct function key is pressed.

The functions are described individually in the following sub-sections.

3.1.	Help (F1)

Displays a summary of available functions and keys.

3.2.	Select Method (F2)

Pressing F2 rotates through the available methods.

3.3.	Define Exclusions (F3)

For consistency all fields entered on this screen are treated as exclusions. Option fields 
should be marked with 'X' to exclude the option or blank to include it (e.g. Optimisation: 
X will turn off optimisation). The remaining fields hold a number which is either a 
minimum or a maximum value.

Exclusions may be changed while composition is in progress. However, the composing 
table will not be optimised for the new criteria until it is rebuilt (F4). Furthermore, 
compositions currently listed will not necessarily satisfy the new criteria.

The following editing keys are available:

X, x		Mark as excluded
0-9   		Numbers for maximum and minimum values
Space		Remove exclusions, clear values to zero
Left		Move cursor left through or between input fields
Right		Move cursor right through or between input fields
Up		Move up through the input fields
Down		Move down through the input fields
Tab		Move to next field
Backtab		Move to previous field
Home		Move to first field
End		Move to last field
Enter		Accept and edit field input, move to next input field

The individual exclusion fields are described in the following subsections:

3.3.1.	Lengths Below/Above

These input fields are used to define the minimum and maximum length of the 
compositions required. The default is 5000 to 5376. Keep these values in a reasonably 
tight range to minimise search time.

3.3.2.	Longest yet

This option is useful when attempting a search where you are not sure whether a 
composition of the desired length will exist. SMC will progressively add the longest 
composition yet found to the composition list, even though the minimum length criteria has 
not been satisfied. These short compositions are given a score of their length, which puts 
the longest at the top of the list but relegates them all to the bottom of the list as soon as 
compositions of the correct length are found.

3.3.3.	Optimisation

If set to blank, the search will be optimised. Currently, only regenerative optimisation is 
implemented. Whenever the composition runs false, the composing engine backtracks and 
substitutes a call at the previous calling position. As it composes forwards again, it copies 
the pattern of calls from the start of the composition.
The following simple example demonstrates how a 672 of Plain Bob Major would be 
found. In the example a new line indicates that the composition runs false or comes round 
early. Each letter corresponds to a Plain, Bobbed or Singled lead and new leads generated 
without backtracking are in lower case.
Without optimisation:

PPPPPPP
PPPPPPbppppppp
PPPPPPBPPPPPPbppppppp
PPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPb
PPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPsppppppp
PPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPSPPPPPPbppppppp
PPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPSPPPPPPBPPPPPPbppppppp
PPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPSPPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPb
PPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPSPPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPs

With regenerative optimisation:

PPPPPPP
PPPPPPbppppppbppppppb
PPPPPPBPPPPPPBPPPPPPspppppppbpppppppbppppppps

Without optimisation the composing engine has to backtrack eight times; with 
optimisation only twice. As demonstrated by this example, all multipart compositions are 
found  immediately after the first part has been found, without further backtracking. 
Furthermore, regenerative optimisation causes the search to accelerate dramatically as 
soon as the composing engine has backtracked as far as the first course.

If some calling positions are excluded (e.g. for tenors together), regeneration following 
backtracking is deferred to the end of following course. This prevents calls being 
regenerated which don't satisfy the exclusion criteria. 

The only compositions missed by regenerative optimisation are rotations. Therefore, the 
optimisation and rotation options should be used in combination to ensure that all 
compositions are found.

3.3.4.	Tenors split course heads

This option can be used to find tenors together compositions which use structures such as 
I/V, 4/I, I/O/V/V and S3/S5 which work for the method concerned. It works by marking 
the tenors split course heads as excluded in the composing table. When the table is built, 
any leads which cannot be reached due to the course head exclusions are themselves 
excluded. Only the required course structures then remain. The Display Composing Table 
(F8) function can be used to see the effect this option has on the leads and calls available.

Although little in the way of call exclusions should be applied for this option to work well, 
it is sometimes a good idea to exclude calls where the tenor makes fourths. This prevents 
SMC generating long courses where the tenor rolls round on the front, repeatedly making 
fourths, yet still returning to the seventh at the course end.

3.3.5.	Reverse  

This option controls the direction of the composing engine. The default is excluded; this 
means that the composing engine will start with all leads set to Plain. When the 
composition runs false, the plain will first be changed to a bob and then a single, subject to 
call exclusions. If not excluded, the reverse happens i.e. the composing engine starts with 
all calls set to single and change these to bobs and then plains. Reversing composition will 
find the compositions containing the highest number of singles/bobs first.

The composing table must be re-built after changing this option.

3.3.6.	Rotation  

This option will take each composition found by the composing engine and rotate it by 
course heads. Each rotation is then evaluated to score it and check it meets the exclusion 
criteria. Using this option ensures that the most musical rotation is found quickly. It 
should also be used with the optimisation option to ensure that all compositions are found.

3.3.7.	Rounds @ Hand, Bank, Int, LH

Rounds exclusions can be used to find compositions only coming round at handstroke by 
excluding Rounds @ Back, or internally within the lead by excluding Rounds @ LH (lead 
head). Conversely, if only conventional finishes are required, mark Rounds @ Int 
(internal) as excluded.

If, for example, you require all the quarterpeals coming round at backstroke snap, exclude 
Rounds @ LH with a minimum length of 1250 and a maximum length of (say) 1442.  

3.3.8.	87s @ Back, 82s, 83s

These options allow you exclude less musical leads such as those which contain 87s at 
backstroke, or 82s/83s at either stroke.

3.3.9.	Number of Parts (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,12)

These options allow you to search for multiparts only (by excluding one parts), or search 
for compositions with a specified number of parts. If the optimisation option is selected 
and one parts are excluded, the composing engine will further optimise the search. When 
the composition runs false, backtracking is forced until a change of calling within the first 
part occurs, since regenerative optimisation ensures that multiparts are found from the 
first part without running false. For this purpose, the size of the first part is determined as 
maximum length divided by minimum part size. Restricting the search to say three parts 
and above can very substantially reduce the search time.
When searching for multiparts where the part heads are not course heads (e.g. seven 
parts), individual calling positions should not be excluded when regenerative optimisation 
is required, otherwise some multipart compositions may be missed. 

3.3.10.	Plains/Bobs/Singles

These options give the ability to restrict the search to compositions containing specific 
numbers of  plains, bobs and singles both in total and in each calling position. The calling 
position columns relate to the position of the tenor at backstroke after the call has been 
made e.g. 8ths is Home, 7ths is Wrong and 3rds is Before (at a bob).

Set the maximum (Plains/Bobs/Singles Above) to zero if no calls are required in a calling 
position, since this helps optimisation of the composing table. Always use above zero and 
below 9999 if you do not require a specific number of calls, since SMC will not waste 
time counting calls if there are no maxima or minima. Setting the Any/Above option to 
zero will exclude that type of call completely.

If call maxima are set to anything other than 9999, the composing engine will count the 
number of calls in each calling position (and in total) while composing. If any are 
exceeded, it will backtrack. Compositions not achieving a specified minimum number of 
calls are discarded after the composing engine has found them.

These options allow searches for compositions of a particular type, such as tenors together 
with only one Before, or compositions only containing singles at Home.

3.3.11.	Minimum Musical Rows

These minimum criteria are checked for each composition found by the composing engine. 
If the composition (or any rotations of it) does not satisfy the criteria it will be discarded. 
Although these exclusions allow filtering of the compositions to be viewed, they have a 
relatively small effect on composing performance.

The musical rows provided are mostly four bell masks, and the minimum can be specified 
for the back and front (i.e. back/front) of the row. Apart from crus (combination roll ups - 
xx78, where xx is any combination of 4,5 &6), where up to 144 can be specified and 
5678cmb (combinations of 5,6,7 & 8)  where up to 576 can be specified, all other values 
can be set from 0 to 24.

Eight individual rows can also be specified as mandatory in compositions by setting the 
minimum value to 1. These are:

13572468  Q(ueens)
12753468  W(hittingtons) 
15263748  T(ittums)
87654321  B(ack Rounds)
12563478  H(agdyke)
14327658  R(ollercoaster)
65432178  6  
76543218  7

3.4.	Define Inclusions (Alt F3)

Pressing Alt F3 brings up a screen which allows course heads to be selected by wild card 
(i.e. the character "?"). If the course head is followed by "+", "-" or blank then only in 
course, out of course or both course heads will be included, respectively. For example, to 
select the 24 course heads of Simon Humphrey's Lincolnshire, use the following:

1?3???78+
1??3??78-

If calls are restricted by exclusion to middles, wrongs and homes, SMC will very quickly 
find all the possible arrangements of these 24 courses. 

Inclusion (Alt F3) takes effect before exclusion (F3) and controls the building of the 
composing table. Any matching course heads are marked for inclusion and the remainder 
are excluded. It is important to recognise that specifying courses for inclusion does not 
guarantee that they will be included, since exclusion criteria take precedence over 
inclusion criteria. Furthermore, any leads which cannot be reached (due to call restrictions 
or exclusion of intermediate leads) will also be excluded.

Inclusion only applies to course heads, not courses. This means that in the above example 
the tenors could be split within the courses, or parts of other tenors together courses could 
be used (e.g. between M and W). If strict tenors together is a requirement, then calls which 
could split the tenors must also be excluded to ensure that this is the case.

The following editing keys are available:

+		Mark course head mask as positive nature only
-		Mark course head mask as negative nature only
?		Wild card in course head mask 
0-9		Fixed bells in course head mask
Space		Mark course head mask as either nature
Left		Move cursor left through or between input fields
Right		Move cursor right through or between input fields
Up		Move up through the input fields
Down		Move down through the input fields
Tab		Move to next field
Backtab		Move to previous field
Home		Move to first field
End		Move to last field
Enter		Accept and edit field input, move to next input field

3.5.	Build Composing Table (F4)

Pressing F4 will build the composing table for the currently selected method, inclusion 
criteria and exclusion criteria. On completion, the composing engine (F9) is automatically 
started and the Composition List (F5) function is invoked to list any compositions found.

The composing table is designed to minimise the work required by the composing engine 
to achieve the highest possible composing speed. The table contains a row for every 
possible lead head plus an additional row for starting rounds, making 5041 rows in total. 
The table can be viewed using the Display Composing Table function (F8).

The table is optimised based on the specified inclusion (Alt F3) and exclusion (F3) criteria 
to  restrict the number of lead heads down from the 5040 available.   Using the tenor 
positions where calls are permitted, it works out which leads it is possible to get to from 
rounds and excludes the rest. For example, if singles and all calls which would part the 
tenors are excluded, 420 leads would be available. The number of leads available for 
composition is displayed at the top of the screen. 

The function transposes the permitted plains, bobs and singles for each lead head and 
retains the table row number for the destination lead heads against the source lead head in 
the table. It then works out the table row number for each false lead head and stores these, 
omitting any which are not applicable due to the false leads being excluded. The highest 
number of false lead heads held for a lead is displayed, together with the maximum 
number of  false lead heads possible for the method.

At present, the program does not use extended memory and therefore the composing table 
size is limited by the conventional memory available under DOS. The table is currently 
474K and number of false lead heads which can be stored without increasing its size is 18. 
If this number is exceeded for any lead, the message "FLH table array overflow. Increase 
lead/call exclusions" is displayed. To overcome this, the exclusions for calls, lead and 
course heads must be tightened up and the table rebuilt (F4) until 18 or less false lead 
heads occur. 

The function also counts and stores in the table the number of selected musical 
combinations contained in each lead for later analysis of compositions found.
The time taken to build the table is proportional to the number of leads included. To build 
a table for all 5040 lead heads takes less than a minute on a 25Mhz 80486 PC.
Once the table has been compiled, the program can compose without generating any rows 
from place notation, transposing any lead heads, or working out any falseness. 
Furthermore, musical assessment can be done merely by adding the totals stored for the 
selected lead heads.

It should be noted that the current composition list is discarded when the composing table 
is rebuilt.

3.6.	Display Composition List (F5)

This functions is automatically invoked when composition starts, but can be re invoked at 
any time by pressing F5. Any new compositions will automatically appear on the list as 
they are found.

Compositions are listed in descending order of merit as assessed by the composition score. 
The score is calculated by SMC when the composition is evaluated. For speed of scoring, 
the score is a 32-bit number comprising the sum of binary weighting factors applied to 
musical and other criteria. The weighting factors, which are not currently user modifiable, 
are set as follows:

Measure			Weight (back)		Weight (front)

not "longest yet"	2**31			N/A
Longer compositions	length x 2**0		N/A
Shorter compositions	40320-length x 2**1	N/A
87s at backstroke	720-count x 2**17	N/A
82s			720-count x 2**12	N/A
83s			720-count x 2**11	N/A
Number of parts		count x 2**17		N/A
5678 combinations	count x 2**5		count x 2**5
combination roll-ups	count x 2**17		count x 2**16
5678s			count x 2**17		count x 2**16
6578s			count x 2**16		count x 2**15
4578s			count x 2**14		count x 2**12
4678s			count x 2**14		count x 2**12
6478s			count x 2**13		count x 2**11
5478s			count x 2**13		count x 2**11
3578s			count x 2**14		count x 2**12
3478s			count x 2**14		count x 2**12
8765s			count x 2**15		count x 2**13
7568s			count x 2**15		count x 2**13
7658s			count x 2**15		count x 2**13
7468s			count x 2**10		count x 2**7
2468s			count x 2**10		count x 2**7
1234s			count x 2**10		count x 2**7
4321s			count x 2**10		count x 2**7

The function displays a list of summary information for each composition found, namely:

No		Number of the composition in the list
Elapsed		Elapsed time taken to find the composition
Lnth		Length of the composition
Prt		Count of equal parts
Ps		Count of plains
Bs		Count of bobs
Ss		Count of singles
87s		Count of 87s at backstroke
82s		Count of 82s
83s		Count of 83s
crus		Count of combination roll ups (back/front)
xxxxs		Count of xxxxs (back/front) where xxxx is a four bell mask
5678cmb		Count of 5678 combinations (back/front)
R		If "Y", the lead contains 12345678 (Rounds)
Q		If "Y", the lead contains 13572468 (Queens)
W		If "Y", the lead contains 12753468 (Whittingtons)
T		If "Y", the lead contains 15263748 (Tittums)
B		If "Y", the lead contains 87654321 (Back Rounds)
H		If "Y", the lead contains 12563478 (Hagdyke)
R		If "Y", the lead contains 14327658 (Rollercoaster)
6		If "Y", the lead contains 65432178
7		If "Y", the lead contains 76543218
Compscore	The calculated score for the composition 

64K of memory is reserved for this list and the compositions are held in compressed 
format. Approximately 500 normal peal length compositions can be held. When the list is 
full, compositions with the lowest composition score are dropped from the table to allow 
better compositions to be added. A count of all compositions meeting the selection criteria 
and the number currently listed is constantly displayed. 

Compositions can be manually removed from the list by pressing the delete key when the 
composition is highlighted.

The following keys can be used in this function:

Left		Page Left
Right		Page Right
Up		Move up one line
Down		Move down one line
Page Down   	Page Down
Page Up		Page Up
Home		Top of list
End		Bottom of list
Enter/Space 	Display composition (see below)
Delete		Delete composition from list

3.7.	Display Composition from List (Enter)

Pressing Enter or the space bar while the composition list is displayed (F5) will display the 
highlighted composition, in standard notation. Note certain assumptions have been made 
to make the formatting of compositions logically consistent for all lead orders. The main 
ones are:

1)	The calling positions are presented in columns according to place bell order of the 
	tenor in the plain course.

2)	Calls are shown on the same line regardless of  intervening course heads, provided that 
	the call is in the same column or a later column from the previous call.

3)	When a new line is required (i.e. when a call is required in an earlier column than the 
	previous call) and there is no intervening course head, the lead head of the previous call is 
	displayed in parentheses in its place.

4)	If the composition is an exact multipart, a line is drawn after each part.

5)	If the composition overflows the screen, dots are shown on the first and line to indicate 
	where the composition has scrolled off screen.

The following keys can be used in this function:

Left		Page Left through list summary
Right		Page Right through list summary
Down		Move down the composition one line
Up		Move up the composition one line
Page Down   	Display the next composition in the list
Page Up		Display the previous composition in the list
Enter/Space  	Return to Composition List
Delete		Delete composition from list

3.8.	Display Composition in Progress (F6)

Pressing F6 invokes the dynamic display function for the current composition. It displays 
the composition currently being developed, in standard notation, allowing the progress of 
the composing engine to be monitored visually. Snapshots of the composition are 
displayed whenever the composing engine releases control. This is either when a 
composition has been found or after every 10,000 leads generated. This gives sub-second 
refresh of the screen.

This function reduces composing speed by approximately 5%. Cursor and paging keys are 
not  available.

3.9.	Display Music Analysis (F7)

Not yet implemented. A music summary is shown in the composition list (F5).

3.10.	Display Composing Table (F8)

Pressing F8 displays the composing table. A row exists on this table for each of the 5040 
lead heads plus an additional row for rounds (start and finish). Excluded rows are not 
displayed. The lead heads for calls and false leads are actually held in the table as row 
numbers but are displayed as lead heads.

Viewing the table is a useful way of checking that the inclusions and exclusions have had 
the effect you intended.

Column headings are displayed as follows:

LHNo		Lead head number (i.e. the row number in the composing table)
Leadhead	The lead head suffixed by its nature
Len		The lead length - constant, except where the lead contains rounds
Pt		The number of parts in the composition, if this lead head is a part head
Plain		The next lead head if no call, blank if the call/lead is excluded 
Bob		The next lead head if bobbed, blank if the call/lead is excluded
Single		The next lead head if singled, blank if the call/lead is excluded
R		If "Y", the lead contains 12345678 (Rounds)
Q		If "Y", the lead contains 13572468 (Queens)
W		If "Y", the lead contains 12753468 (Whittingtons)
T		If "Y", the lead contains 15263748 (Tittums)
B		If "Y", the lead contains 87654321 (Back Rounds)
H		If "Y", the lead contains 12563478 (Hagdyke)
R		If "Y", the lead contains 14327658 (Rollercoaster)
6		If "Y", the lead contains 65432178
7		If "Y", the lead contains 76543218
I		If "Y", the lead has been included in the developing composition
C		The call in the developing composition (P, B or S)
87s		The number of 87s at backstroke in the lead
82s/83s		The number of 82s & 83s in the lead
crus		The number of crus in the lead (front & back)

3.11.	Suspend/Restart Composition (F9)

The composing engine is automatically started after the Build Table function (F4). 
However it can be suspended by pressing F9 and restarted by pressing F9 again.

The composing engine runs as a pseudo-background process so that all other functions 
remain available while composition progresses. To maximise efficiency the composing 
engine only checks for keyboard input after every 10,000 leads. This may result in a 
noticeable slowing of response to other functions if a low lead generation rate (< 30K/sec) 
is being achieved. If this is a problem, press F9 to suspend composition while other 
functions are used.

The elapsed time from building the composing table, the number of leads checked (in 
millions), the number of leads checked per second (in thousands) and a percentage 
complete figure is displayed. These are updated whenever there is any new information to 
display or a key is pressed. The number of leads per second is simply the number of leads 
checked divided by the elapsed time and the percentage complete is a crude measure of the 
search progress based on the bland assumption that all branches of the search tree are the 
same length (which of course they are not). 

The composing engine is a small routine, with optimised code to maximise composing 
speed. It checks the following to ensure truth and restrict the size of the search, namely:

*	the lead  is not already in the composition
*	any referenced false lead heads are not in the composition
*	the maximum  composition length has not been exceeded
*	the maximum number of  calls (for particular calling positions) have not been exceeded
*	the maximum part size has not been exceeded (only applies if one parts are excluded 
	and regenerative optimisation is in effect)

It then repeats this process until a lead containing rounds is found (these are flagged in the 
table). If the minimum composition length has been reached it then submits the 
composition for evaluation.

The evaluation routine checks that all minimum exclusion criteria (e.g. for musical rows) 
have been satisfied. If specified, it then rotates the composition by course heads and 
evaluates the rotations. Any non-duplicate compositions satisfying the selection criteria 
are added to the composition list with summary information. 

3.12.	Quit (F10)

Pressing F10 exits SMC. 

4.	Feedback  

SMC was developed in 1992/93 and although still in the development stage, it has had 
little modification since then. However, I do intend at some point to redevelop it for 
Windows and extended memory. At the same time I would like to make more features user 
configurable.

The current version is being made available to demonstrate its capabilities and to elicit 
useful feedback for future versions. Please note that I cannot guarantee the reliability of 
the software and therefore assumptions should not be made that SMC has found all the 
compositions for a given set of criteria, or even that the compositions displayed are true.

For the purposes of demonstration, the standard eight Surprise Major methods are built 
into to SMC. If you need a composition for a method not currently included in SMC, 
please contact me via the Ringers BBS or via the internet and I will see if I can help.

All rights to the software are reserved by the author, and it must not be modified in any 
way, or distributed for sale or gain without express permission.

I would appreciate feedback on SMC. In particular, if you have ideas on the following:

*	further ways to optimise the search algorithm
*	a better way of estimating search time and completeness of search
*	improvements to composition scoring
*	new areas of functionality

I can be contacted via the Ringers BBS or the internet (johng@lfgms.logica.com).
