<h4><a name="callingbells">Calling Bells and Course Ends</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Normally, calls are made relative to the tenor. If you
    want to produce compositions with a different calling bell,
    use something like this:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 2 1234xxxxxx</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Here the second becomes the calling bell, so SMC32 will
    produce compositions where (for example, in Royal) a Wrong
    will be called when the second is in 9th's place. As well as
    the calling bell, you can tell SMC32 which other bells are
    fixed at the course end. In the example above, bells 2, 3 and
    4 are the fixed bells, and so must all come home whenever the
    second does. It may not be necessary to specify this if your
    calls do not affect 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>You can have more than one type of course end. This can be
    useful for generating compositions with different back bell
    positions. Here's an example:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 7 1xxxxx7890 1xxxxx7089</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>This will allow Tittums course ends as well as the normal,
    backstroke-home type. You must make sure calls exist which
    will enable SMC32 to get from one type of course end to
    another. <span style="color:#FF0000">WARNING:</span> The Tittums
    example we have here is quite dangerous, because it is easy
    to get into it (with say a sixth's place calling position for
    the 7th) but difficult to return <em>directly</em> to
    backstroke courses. SMC32 will waste vast amounts of search
    time if it cannot 'get out' of a particular course-end
    position. It is often necessary to give a third, linking
    position to overcome this:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 7 1xxxxx7890 1xxxxx7089
            1xxxxx7908</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>You can limit the number of times the linking course
    appears by adding it as an undesirable music definition.</p>
    <p>One other common use of the Callfrom instruction, is to
    allow fewer fixed bells than usual, or ask for more. Again on
    ten bells, this line has the tenor as calling bell, but also
    keeps the 6th fixed:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 0 1xxxx67890</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Sometimes composers allow the 7th to enter the work with
    calls (in Royal) when the tenor is in 7th's place. This is
    often used to generate 357642 coursing orders and the
    corresponding x234567 rollups. You could get SMC32 to produce
    similar compositions by giving a high score to these rollups,
    and allowing the 7th to enter the work:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 0 1xxxxxx890</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>However, if you <u>only</u> want the 357642 coursing order,
    it would be much more efficient to specify exactly that
    course end:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 0 1xxxxx7890 1674523890</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Then SMC32 will then not look at any other non-home
    courses for the 7th.</p>
    <p>These ideas are just some of the possibilities which you
    can explore with the Callfrom instruction. It is well worth
    experimenting, but you must think carefully about the calling
    positions you need. Remember also that the more types of
    course structure you allow, the more search possibilities
    there will be, and the slower the search will run.</p>
    <p><span style="color:#FF0000">IMPORTANT WARNING:</span> some types
    of course end won't work correctly with the rotational search
    algorithm. You may have to use the &quot;<a
    href="index.html#Flags">noregen</a>&quot; flag to disable the
    rotational search manually. See the <a
    href="smc32tech.html#Unresolved Issues">Unresolved Issues</a>
    section.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="splittenors">Split Tenors Searches</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you want the tenors to be split
    within a course, you can specify calls such as I, V or 4 (see
    the <a href="#Calls">Calls</a> section below). SMC32 will automatically find
    course structures which use these calls, but bring the tenors
    back together at every course end. Of course, if (in an f-group
    method) you only allow I but not V, SMC32 will revert to a
    pure tenors-together search, because calls at I alone cannot
    bring the tenors back together.</p>
    <p>To allow general tenors-split
    searches, where the tenors do not have to come back together,
    use the <code>Callfrom</code> line
    (<a href="#callingbells">see above</a>). The
    calls and calling positions you specify (see <a href="#Calls">Calls</a>
    below) will still apply, so normally you want to give every
    possible calling position. Here's an example for Major:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 8 1xxxxxx8</code></dd>
        <dd><code>Bob 2I 3B 44 5V 6M 7W 8H</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p><span style="color:#FF0000">WARNING:</span> this
    type of search will be vastly slower than tenors-together
    searches, and is only suitable for short lengths on ten bells
    or less.</p>
    <p>This example is still restrictive
    when making multi-part searches, in that the calling bell
    must be home at the end of each part. Even for one-part
    searches, it means that no rotations will be considered where
    the tenor is not the calling bell. You can release this
    restriction by making <em>non course-structured</em>
    searches, which have no special calling bell and in which all
    calls are allowed:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom -</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>In this case, all types of part end
    are allowed, and all possible calling positions will be
    enabled (it overrides any Bob, Single or Plain instruction
    given). This search will be <em>even slower</em>, and for peals you 
	may need to limit it to 7 parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Calls">Calls</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>You can override the default calls
    and calling positions by specifying your own. Add a line in
    the input file (after the 'minimum score' number but before
    any 'music' line) starting with <code>bob</code>, <code>single</code>
	or <code>extreme</code>. This is optionally followed by 
	<code>pn</code> and the place notation of the call (at the
    leadend). This is followed by calling positions, which should
    be in the form Xname, where 'X' is the position of the tenor
    AFTER the call (2...9, 0, E, T) and 'name' is the name you
    would like to give this position (e.g. H for Home). There
    should be no spaces between the bell place and the name. Here's
    some examples:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Bob 2I 3B 5V 6M 7W 8R</code></dd>
        <dd><code>Single 0M EW TH</code></dd>
        <dd><code>Extreme pn1456 8Home</code></dd>
        <dd><code>Single</code></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note that SMC32 won't find
    compositions with singles or extremes unless you specify them
    on a line in the input file. The last example - just 
	<code>Single</code> on its
    own - will give you singles with tenors-together calling
    positions. If you want to use extremes (and the 'big bob'
    common in Royal and Max is one good reason that you might),
    you should <u>always</u> specify a call pn, because the
    default is the same as a single!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><span style="color:#FF0000">WARNING</span>.
	On higher numbers, it is best if you can to
    stick to tenors-together calls. Especially on Maximus and
    above, if too many tenors-split leads can be reached with
    your chosen calls, SMC32's table space can overflow. This
    should result in an error message and the program exiting,
    but it is possible that SMC32 will crash!!!! Uh oh! BUG ALERT!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="callcounting">Call Counting</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>It can be useful to limit the number
    of calls that the composing engine is allowed to use in any
    one composition. For instance, in Cambridge Major, you might
    want to restrict the number of short courses by placing a
    limit on Befores; or you might want to limit the total number
    of Singles used. To do this, use a &quot;less than&quot;
    symbol (&lt;) after the calling position you want to restrict,
    followed immediately by the maximum number of calls to be
    allowed there. For example, the following line limits the
    number of Befores in each composition to four:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Bob 3B&lt;4 6M 7W 8H</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Note that, although the &quot;less
    than&quot; symbol is used, any number of calls up to <em>and
    including</em> that specified will be
    allowed. You can also place an overall limit on calls,
    regardless of position - the next example restricts
    compositions to those containing ten singles or less, and in
    addition, only two of them can be Homes:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Single &lt;10 0M EW TH&lt;2</code></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes carefully-chosen call
    limits can dramatically improve composition speed, for
    example by ensuring SMC32 doesn't waste time considering
    compositions with too many short or long courses, which could
    not make the required length.</p>
    <p>Want to set a minimum number of calls?
    The best way of doing this is to limit the number of plain
    leads in the corresponding position - see the <a
    href="#disallowingplains">section below</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="disallowingplains">Disallowing Plains</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Plain leads can be restricted in a similar way to other
    calls. You can prevent plain leads at certain positions, or
    place a maximum limit on the number of plain leads allowed in
    each position of the calling bell. The syntax is similar to
    that for other calls (see above) but you musn't give calling
    position names. Here's an example:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Plain 2&lt;0 6&lt;0 7&lt;0</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Here no plains are allowed in leads where the tenor would
    becomes 2nd, 6th, or 7th's place bells. For Cambridge Major,
    the effect of this would be to produce touches containing
    only short courses. Note that any positions unspecified (here
    3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th's place) remain unlimited.</p>
    <p>It's often useful to specify limits on plain leads in
    conjunction with bobs or singles at the same position. For
    instance, the following gives a very efficient way to search
    for 5000 change peals of London No.3 consisting of ten short
    courses:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Plain 2&lt;5</code></dd>
        <dd><code>Bob 2I&lt;10 55 8M 9W 0H</code></dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt>If the limit had only been placed on the bob In, then
            compositions with 13 full courses and one short
            course would also have been possible. However, do
            take care with this and similar techniques - note for
            instance that if you had mistakenly set a limit of 4
            Plains, no compositions of peal length would be
            possible.</dt>
    </dl>
    <p><span style="color:#FF0000">WARNING</span>: Call counts on plain
    leads that are internal to a node are currently ignored. See <a
    href="smc32tech.html#Unresolved Issues">Unresolved Issues</a>
    for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="cominground">Coming Round</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's very important to understand
    that SMC32 will normally only find compositions coming round
    in the 'usual' place, i.e. at the leadhead. The reason for
    this is simply speed - SMC32 can run a much faster algorithm
    if it is allowed to ignore backstroke snap finishes and the
    like. This algorithm is known as a <em>rotationally sorted
    tree search</em>, and also has the major benefit of finding
    only one unique rotation of each composition.</p>
    <p>To take an example: for Cambridge
    Major, bobs only, there are 99 possible peal compositions,
    but only five of these are not rotations of each other. SMC32,
    in its default mode of operation, will find just those five.
    You need not worry that the rotations have been missed - the
    program will automatically rotate each touch found, and
    output the 'best' one. (See also <code>allrots</code> in the
    <a href="index.html#Flags">Flags</a> section).</p>
    <p>If you DO want to find snap finishes,
    you must use the following line:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Rounds internal</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>This will force SMC32 to find ONLY
    compositions coming round at internal changes (i.e. not the
    leadhead at all). It can be quite useful to run this in
    addition to an ordinary search, in order to find all possible
    touches. Remember you are likely to need singles to reach
    rounds at a backstroke snap, and tenors-split calling
    positions are normally needed for handstroke finishes. SMC32
    will complain if there is no way of bringing a touch round!
    Also notice that a multipart search is NOT possible, and SMC32
    will again complain if you try and do one.</p>
    <p>If you really must find all
    compositions in one search, you can use</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Rounds internal leadhead</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>And SMC32 will attempt to find
    everything. There are several drawbacks with this: the search
    will be much, much slower; each rotation will be output as a
    separate composition; and multipart searches cannot be made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="NonRounds">Starts and Finishes other than Rounds</a></h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Since version 0.94, SMC32 can perform searches for blocks that do not start or
	end in rounds. This can be very useful for augmenting hand-produced compositions.
	To start a search from a row other than rounds, use a line such as:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>startfrom 13425678</code></dd>
    </dl>
	<p>You must give a row with the treble at lead, and with the right number 
	of bells!</p>
	<p>You can determine the finishing row of a search in a similar way:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>endin 17856342</code></dd>
    </dl>
	<p>Note that the "<code>Rounds</code>" directive can still be used to specify
	 whether the search can finish at the <code>endin</code> row at leadhead, leadend, or 
	 internally to the lead.</p>
	<p>Please note that, if you have different <code>startfrom</code> and
	<code>endin</code> rows, the rotationally sorted search will be turned off,
	so the search may be slower than you expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="musthave">Linkage Searches</a></h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Since version 0.96, SMC32 can perform linkage searches: that is, you can
	specify one or more blocks which should be present in the composition, and
	the software will try and link them together. This, together with the ability
	to do <a href="#NonRounds">Non-Rounds</a> starts and finishes, turns SMC32
	into a uniquely flexible composing tool.</p>
	<p>
	To specify blocks for a linkage search, use either the <code>musthave</code>
	or the <code>shouldhave</code> directive. Both have the same syntax, for example:
	</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>shouldhave 1432657890 1642759208 H H MW W</code></dd>
    </dl>
	<p>
	In this example we are specifying a block which starts at the <em>entry</em>
	leadhead <code>1432657890</code>, and by the calling "H, H, MW, W" reaches 
	the <em>exit</em> leadhead of <code>1642759208</code>. Effectively we are saying
	that, if coursing order 63425 is reached, we want the composition then
	to proceed Home (64235), Home (62345), Middle (62453), Wrong (24653), and 
	Wrong again to exit at CO 46253.</p>
	<p>
	Spacing is not important when entering the calling, but SMC32 will complain 
	if the exit leadhead cannot be reached. Note that you can specify an exit 
	leadhead up to a course after the final call, and the block will include the
	requisite number of plain leads; similarly for the entry leadhead.</p>
	<p>
	You can specify as many <code>musthave</code> or <code>shouldhave</code>
	blocks as you like. During composition, whenever the search reaches the
	entry point of either type of block, SMC32 will immediately include the block
	in the composition, if possible. Furthermore, no calls will be allowed that
	jump into the middle of the block. (This means that no compositions will be 
	produced that have the block split into sections: if you want to allow for this, 		
	you must split your block up manually into two or more <code>musthave</code> or
	<code>shouldhave</code> lines.)</p>
	<p>
	<code>Musthave</code> blocks work as described above, but are even more
	strict than <code>shouldhave</code>; SMC32 will not allow into the composition 
	any leads which are false against a <code>musthave</code> block. This means that
	<code>musthave</code> blocks are always clean-proof against the rest of the
	composition and hence available for use by the search (although compositions which
	<em>don't</em> contain all specified <code>musthave</code> blocks can still be
	found.)</p>
	<p>
	Because of the benefits in pruning false leads, <code>musthave</code> blocks
	are likely to give much quicker searches than those using <code>shouldhave</code>.
	However, for certain applications, for instance when a musical block is available
	in two mutually-false forms, <code>shouldhave</code> blocks are more appropriate.</p>
	<p>
	Please note that, when using linkage searches, the rotationally sorted search 
	will be disabled, and so multipart searches are NOT possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="bittruth">Bitwise Truth Tables</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>
	New for SMC32 v0.95 is a new way of proof-checking compositions during
	the search. The "Bitwise Truthtable Algorithm" uses a table with one bit per
	node, which is checked off when a node is included in the composition.
	Unlike conventional truthtables, the numbering of false nodes is also optimised
	so that, for a given node, several of its false nodes can be checked off
	simultaneously using a combined 32-bit mask to index the truthtable.</p>
	<p>
	The bitwise truthtable is most useful when the method is very false.
	With false methods, a lot of inner-loop time is spent checking false nodes;
	the bitwise approach can collapse multiple checks into a single operation,
	but carries an overhead, so is slower for methods with few false nodes.
	The break-even point seems around the 10 false-node-per-node mark; for instance
	the "Full Monty" search (Cambridge Major, tenors together, bobs and singles)
	completes around 20% faster with bitwise truth tables turned on. Methods with
	more falseness will do even better.
	</p>
    <p>
	To use bitwise truth tables, add the <code>Bittruth</code> flag to the
	<a href="index.html#Flags">Flags</a> line in your input file. Note that
	extra table-build steps are required to optimise the false-node numbering
	for the bitwise truth table, and these can take many minutes to run, depending
	on the number of nodes in the search.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="palindromic">Palindromic Searches</a></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Palindromic compositions are
    compositions which can be called in reverse order. More
    information about palindromes and why you should want to find
    them is contained in <a
    href="smc32tech.html#Under the Hood">Under
    The Hood</a>. Here we will
    restrict ourselves to the practicalities.</p>
    <p>The <code>Palindromic</code> flag should be added to the <a
    href="index.html#Flags">Flags</a> line in your input file, to tell SMC32 to
    generate palindromic touches only. Note that any <code>Rounds</code> or 
	<code>Parts</code> lines will be disabled.</p>

    href="index.html#Music Definitions">Music Definitions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="undesirablechanges">Undesirable Changes</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>One of the example files supplied
    with SMC32 is the music file <code>major.mus</code>. 
	Let's take a look at it now.</p>
    <p>You will see it contains a lot of
    definitions, including rollups and little-bell music off the
    front. They all have minimums of 0, so it's not essential for
    a composition to have a certain number of any of them. Two
    individual changes - Queens and Tittums - are singled out for
    special merit. We also show how to define combination rollups:
    notice that a 56 rollup will score 250 points <u>plus</u> the
    20 points for being a CRU.</p>
    <p>The most interesting bit is the last
    line: <code>undesirables</code>. Here we have defined changes with 82 or 83
    at the back, and given them a negative score, of -3. This
    means that every time an 82 or 83 is encountered in a touch,
    it will actually <u>reduce</u> the overall score. The
    relatively small -3 score might help to distinguish between
    two compositions that have identical desirable music.</p>
    <p>How does the minimum number of
    changes work for negatively-scoring changes? Here we have
    specified a minimum of -10000, which means a touch will be
    rejected if <u>more</u> than 10000 82s or 83s are present -
    which obviously isn't going to happen. But a value of, say, -2
    would allow only two such changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="excludedchanges">Excluded Changes</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>By making the minimum number of
    changes of an undesirable change 0, we can tell SMC32 not to
    allow any of them at all. This creates a set of <em>excluded</em>
    changes, which can be treated in a special way by SMC32. If
    you are NOT doing a rotational search (that is, you are
    looking for snap finishes only) then the program can delete
    any leads containing these changes during the table building
    phase - it will then never even look at them during the
    composing process. Since the search space is reduced,
    composing speed often increases too!</p>
    <p>Sadly, this optimisation is not
    posisble in the 'normal' search algorithm. This is because
    SMC32 is effectively finding every rotation of a given touch
    in one go - and an excluded change could be present in one
    rotation but not another. So in this case the program checks
    for exclusions as the compositions are produced.</p>

<h3><a
name="musicsuffixes">Handstrokes, Backstrokes, Leadheads and Coursing Orders</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes you may want to count music only at backstroke,
    or only at hand. By appending a row with a 'b' or an 'h' you
    can specify which stroke. For example, the following line
    excludes 65s at backstroke:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>65s at backstroke</code></dd>
        <dd><code>-1 0 xxxx65b</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>If you want to pick out certain leadheads, add 'l' (lower-case
    L) to the row:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>6th at home</code></dd>
        <dd><code>1 12 1xxxx678l</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>This example ensures any composition found will have all
    course ends with the 6th home (but not necessarily all 1xxxx678
    rollups!).</p>
    <p>This leadhead counting system can be extended, to
    automatically count all leads with a certain coursing order.
    If you add 'c' instead of 'l' to a row, you will count every
    matching leadhead, but also <em>every leadhead that can be
    reached from this by plain leads</em>. Look at this example:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>56 unaffected</code></dd>
        <dd><code>100 0 1xxx5678c</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Here any leadhead 1xxx5678 will match; but so will 1x5x7x86,
    157x8x6x, and so on. Essentially, you are asking for all
    leads with coursing order 5xxx6. The 'c' tag will also work
    for non-Plain Bob leadhead methods - it uses the method's own
    leadhead transposition.</p>

<h3><a name="plusorminus">Positive and Negative rows</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>For many centuries, composers have made use of a property
    called <em>the nature of the rows</em>. Every row that can be
    written down falls into one of two categories, depending on
    whether an even or an odd number of swaps of pairs of bells
    is needed to get back to rounds. For example, the row 543216
    is an <em>even</em>, or <em>positive</em> change, because an
    even number of swaps is required (you can do it with 2 swaps
    - 5,1 and 4,2). Conversely, 83425167 is <em>odd</em> or <em>negative</em>
    - if you try swapping pairs of bells until rounds occurs, you
    will always use an odd number of swaps (here the quickest way
    uses 5 swaps).</p>
    <p>SMC32 can score positive and negative changes. Add a '+'
    character to a row if you want to match only positive rows;
    or a '-' character for negative rows. This <em>sign</em>
    character can also be appended to handstroke, backstroke or
    leadhead characters. Here's an example:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Disallow negative course-ends</code></dd>
        <dd><code>-1 0 1xxxxx78l-</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>In this case, we are preventing negative course-ends from
    appearing in our compositions (note the use of the '<code>l</code>' 
	character to match leadheads -
    we don't want to exclude negative rollups at the snap). This
    can be useful, for instance to force an even number of
    singles in each course - because, on even numbers of bells,
    all leadheads are positive until a single is called.</p>

<h3><a name="handbellpositions">Handbell positions</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Handbell ringers often prefer compositions with the 3-4
    and 5-6 pairs coursing. You can count handbell positions with
    the 'c' course tag described above. For example, on 10 bells:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>5-6 coursing</code></dd>
        <dd><code>6 0 1xxxxxxx56c 1xxxxxxx65c</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The row <code>1xxxxxxx56c</code>
    matches not only the leadhead with 5 and 6 in ninth's and
    tenth's place, but also every lead in the plain course from
    this row. If you also swap the 5 and 6 over, you will
    therefore get every possible coursing lead for these two
    bells.</p>
    <p>Other handbell positions are just as easy - here's the 5-6
    position for Royal:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>3-4 in 5-6</code></dd>
        <dd><code>6 0 1xxx34xxxxc 1xxx43xxxxc</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Naturally you could have given any lead in the 5-6 course.
    This music definition is exactly the same:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>3-4 in 5-6</code></dd>
        <dd><code>6 0 13xxxxxxx4c 14xxxxxxx3c</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>You may complain that this system doesn't give the &quot;proper&quot;
    positions. For example, the 5-6 course in Plain Bob Royal
    includes both the opposites and the 4-5 position, depending
    on where the treble comes between the bells. However, on more
    complex methods it is usual to count the entire course from a
    given pair, because the &quot;hunting&quot; positions don't
    necessarily follow the simple Plain Bob rules within the lead.
    </p>
    <p>If you really want to count the Plain Bob type positions,
    the best thing to do is define each lead separately, with the
    'l' tag:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>3-4 in opposites</code></dd>
        <dd><code>6 0 1xx34xxxl 1xx43xxxl 1x3xx4xxl
            1x4xx3xxl 13xxxx4xl 14xxxx3xl</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>This example is just for Major. Positions other than
    Opposites will involve twice as many possible leads!</p>

<h3><a name="wrapmusic">Wrap Music</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>We'll wrap up (ahem!) this discussion on music with a look
    at the exciting field of <em>wrap</em> music. A wrap is a
    musical row that is split over a handstroke and a backstroke.
    For example, every method with Plain Bob leadheads contains
    the following wrap of reverse rounds:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>1<strong>8765432 </strong>handstroke</code></dd>
        <dd><code><strong>1</strong>8674523
            backstroke</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Another good one is the Whittingtons near-miss in the
    first lead of Double Norwich CBM. Listen out for it next time
    you ring the method - it sounds lovely:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>648<strong>21753 </strong>handstroke</code></dd>
        <dd><code><strong>468</strong>12735
            backstroke</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Wraps are only effective if they cross a handstroke-backstroke
    change, because otherwise the handstroke gap interrupts them.
    If you're interested in wrap music, SMC32 can count them for
    you. As an example, we'll take <em>rounds wraps</em> -
    possibly the most dramatic of all, where rounds occurs across
    a change.</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Wraps of Rounds</code></dd>
        <dd><code>10000 0 x1234567/8xxxxxxx xx123456/78xxxxxx
            ...</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>There are another five possible rows we couldn't fit on
    the line here, but hopefully you get the picture and could
    complete the definition (the ... aren't really allowed!). Two
    rows must be specified for each wrap, with a / character
    between them (and no spaces). The first row will match only
    handstrokes, and the second will match only an immediately
    consecutive backstroke.</p>
    <p>It's often hard to work out how many wraps are possible in
    a given method, so be careful with any music minimums you
    specify. On the one hand, there are probably more wraps than
    you might think - there are 16 possible true occurrences of
    wrapped rounds on Eight! - but any given method won't be able
    to achieve anywhere near this number, especially if the
    tenors are kept together. So, experiment and see.</p>
