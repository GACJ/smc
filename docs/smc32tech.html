<blockquote>
    <p>Here we explain a bit about how SMC32
    works. You don't need to know any of this to use SMC32 to
    produce compositions successfully, but a bit of understanding
    can help you to get better, or quicker, results.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Nodes">Nodes</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>SMC32 doesn't use place notation, or
    calculate changes, when it is composing. It doesn't even look
    at leadends or leadheads. Instead, it travels from node to
    node down the mysterious composition tree! A node is really
    just an address in memory, and represents the step from one
    calling position to the next. For example, in London Major,
    there is a node starting at rounds and ending at the Middle -
    one lead long. There are obviously many other nodes which
    cover the same distance, such as that from 13246578 to
    14538276 (the handstroke before the Middle). But, unless you
    specify split tenors course-ends, there <u>won't</u> be a
    node from 12345687, because that course end can't possibly
    exist in a tenors-together composition. SMC32 only looks at
    nodes that can be reached with the given parameters.</p>
    <p>Continuing with the London example,
    there is another type of node which runs from the Middle to
    the Before. This covers two leads, so allows SMC32 to skip
    ahead even faster - remember, it goes directly from one node
    address to the next, without calculating the intervening
    changes, because the steps between nodes are pre-calculated.
    In tenors-together Major, there are five nodes per course. In
    Royal, just three.</p>
    <p>How is falseness checked when all the
    changes are missed out? This is the table-building code's
    main (and slowest!) job. For each node that can possibly be
    reached, the table-builder finds any and all other nodes that
    contain changes duplicated with it. Then, when SMC32 is
    composing, it can convince itself that a given node is true
    against the rest of the composition, by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Checking the node itself hasn't
            been used before;</li>
        <li>Checking that none of its false
            nodes have been used before.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each of these steps entails a single
    test of a flag in the appropriate node, so is very quick. On
    a Pentium MMX, SMC32 can check a node and move on to the next
    in as little as 20 machine cycles (around 25 nanoseconds on a
    800MHz machine!), depending on the degree of falseness. The
    number of millions of nodes that SMC32 has calculated and
    checked is displayed on the screen whilst composing is in
    process - it is the <code>MNodes</code> figure. A big search can 
	cover <em>millions</em> of millions of nodes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Rotational Sorting">Rotational Sorting</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>So, what is this mysterious 'rotationally
    sorted tree search'? Is it too good to be true?</p>
    <p>To answer those questions, we'll
    first look at how a standard tree search works. Imagine we
    are finding touches of Plain Bob Minor. SMC32 always tries
    plain nodes first, so the first touch found will be the plain
    course:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>PPPPP</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>To find further compositions, SMC32 <em>backtracks</em>,
    and changes the last plain to a bob - effectively, it is
    choosing a different branch of the search tree. The composing
    engine then proceeds with more plains, until the touch runs
    false:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>PPPP-PPPP<span style="color:#FF0000">P</span></code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Another backtrack, and another,
    before rounds comes up again, with the familiar three Homes:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>PPPP-PPPP-PPPP<span style="color:#FF0000">P</span></code></dd>
        <dd><code>PPPP-PPPP-PPPP-</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The 'rotational' search works much
    faster, because instead of setting new nodes to be plain, it
    copies the calling from the beginning of the touch. We start
    in the same way:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>PPPPP</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>But after a backtrack operation (to <code>PPPP-</code>),
    subsequent calls are copied, from the first plain. Now we
    find the three Homes immediately:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>PPPP-PPPP-PPPP-</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>It's easy to see how this technique
    can find multi-part compositions rapidly - indeed, SMC32's
    multi-part search depends upon it; it can't find multiparts
    if forced to use the 'standard' tree search.</p>
    <p>But, doesn't this system miss
    compositions out? By the time SMC32 has backtracked to the
    very first call, and changed that to a bob, there will only
    be one possible touch left (assuming singles aren't allowed):</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>---</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>We can't have anything starting <code>-P</code> because SMC32
    has only got a bob to copy! Does this mean touches starting 
	<code>-P</code> have been
    missed? Well, not if you consider their rotations. Take 
	<code>-PP-PP</code>: we
    certainly can't produce that, but it's easy to show that the
    rotation <code>PP-PP-</code> has already been found. In fact, given any
    round-block touch, SMC32 will always find the 'lowest'
    rotation - that is, the one with that begins with the most
    plain leads. This is how the program 'sorts' the rotations..</p>
    <p>Of course, in Surprise, there are
    many compositions beginning <code>-P</code> which come round at a backstroke snap, and
    hence have no rotations. These ARE missed by the rotational
    search, which explains why SMC32 can only use it to find
    round blocks (with rounds at the leadhead).</p>
    <p>Given that caveat, the rotational
    search is guaranteed not to miss anything. It's harder to
    prove the converse, that rotations of compositions are only
    found once. In fact, this is not true with the
    straightforward copying system described: certain types of
    touch <u>will</u> be duplicated. However, SMC32 applies a
    further refinement to the algorithm, to guarantee just one
    unique production of every touch. This is very useful, since
    you can then determine exactly how many unique compositions
    exist.</p>
    <p>A final tweak helps SMC32 cope with
    course-structured compositions - ones where not all calling
    positions are allowed. The call copying must only be used on
    whole courses, otherwise the calling position rules might be
    violated. So, after a backtrack, SMC32 inserts plain nodes
    until the course end, and then proceeds with the copying
    trick.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Table Building">Table Building</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>SMC32 uses a multi-pass table
    building strategy. Its goal is to create a table of <a
    href="#Nodes">Nodes</a>. In the simplest case, each node represents
    one lead. (For course-structured searches, a node may be a
    number of leads between calling positions). The table-builder
    first needs to determine which nodes are reachable with the
    specified calls; it then links all the nodes together using
    these calls. Next, the music present in each node's changes
    is counted, and stored (obviously only if you have used a
    music file). Finally, falseness tables for the nodes are
    calculated.</p>
    <p>These various stages are displayed
    during the initial part of SMC32's run. You will find that
    the falseness calculations normally take longest; the run
    time is largely dependent on the number of reachable nodes,
    so increases if you specify singles or tenors-split calls:
    dramatically so on higher numbers.</p>
    <p>The table builder's main concern is
    that, initially, it has no idea what your method, calls, and
    calling positions are capable of producing. For example, a
    Maximus method with general tenors-split calls can generate
    nearly 40 million possible leads. If SMC32 attempted to
    reserve memory for all of these, you would rapidly run out of
    space on your computer. So, are Maximus (and higher) searches
    impossible? Fortunately, not if you restrict the composition
    criteria, for example by specifying tenors-together calling
    positions. This brings down the total to a much more
    manageable 1320 leads, even with singles. Tenors-together
    searches are entirely feasible up to SMC32's limit of 20
    bells.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Speed">Speed</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Composing programs such as SMC32
    suffer from a huge user inconvenience: it's hard to tell how
    long they are going to run for. Some searches complete in
    milliseconds, while others may (quite literally) take longer
    than the lifetime of the Universe. At what point do you give
    up? How can you get results quicker?</p>
    <p>SMC32 provides a 'percentage complete'
    figure, displayed on the screen whilst composing. This is not
    a completely accurate measure, because it is based on the
    assumption that all branches of the search tree are equally
    likely, which is not true at all. (There are certainly far
    more touches <em>starting</em>
    with a bob Home course, than there are <em>starting</em> with a 
	plain course!) However, it is a useful guide to the practicality of
    a given search. If, after leaving SMC32 running overnight,
    the percentage figure has not changed at all, you can be
    pretty certain it's a hopeless case! Even if some
    compositions have been produced, they are unlikely to be
    anywhere near the best available.</p>
    <p>Generally, deep tree searches into
    large node spaces will be intractable. For example, tenors-split
    searches are much more time-consuming than tenors-together,
    simply because there are so many more combinations to try.
    The depth of search is also important. Looking for one-course
    touches of Royal entails a mere eight possibilities; for two
    courses, this rises to somewhere near 64 - 8 times 8. In
    general, n courses would give a search space of 8 to the
    power n, until we get near the 'falseness limit' of the
    method.</p>
    <p>Falseness is crucial to speed of
    search. Checking more false nodes does slow SMC32 down; but
    falseness also helpfully prunes the search tree. So, the more
    false the method, the sooner the search will complete.
    Compare Cambridge, which can be searched for all possible
    touches in a matter of seconds, with Bristol, which it would
    take billions of years to exhaust. Another way of looking at
    this is that there are very few true touches of Cambridge (only
    five distinct round-block peals), whereas Bristol has an
    almost unlimited number.</p>
    <p>In this respect, machine composers
    provide a useful foil for the human variety. Computers are
    better at false methods, humans at the clean-proof ones.</p>
    <p>Now on to some specifics.</p>
    <h4><a name="Multi-part Searches">Using Multi-part Searches</a></h4>
    <p>Many one-part peal searches will be
    impossible, especially if the method has little falseness, or
    if singles or tenors-split calls are used. However, usually a
    multi-part search will give results very quickly, and the
    resulting compositions will certainly be easier to call!
    Remember that a two-part search is <u>not</u> just two times
    quicker than a one-part: the effect is exponential. If a one
    part peal contains 100 calling positions, a two-part search
    might be up to 2^50 times faster! Try using the following
    line in your method file:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Parts 2 3 4 5 6</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>You might want to use higher part
    numbers for split-tenors multi-parts. For reasonably clean
    treble-dodging mx Major methods, or any Plain method, even
    the two-part search may be too slow. Try:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Parts 3 4 5 6</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <h4><a name="Palindromic Searches">Palindromic Searches</a></h4>
    <p>A palindromic composition is one in two halves: each half
    is the reverse of the other. For example, in Kent, the
    following touch is a palindrome:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>hb mmb b bww bh</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The half-way point (or <em>apex</em>) is the third Before;
    and the calls at Middle are the reverse of those at Wrong.
    This might be easier to see if we write out all the leads:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>-PPP-PPP P--PP-PPP PPP-PPP
            PPP-PP--P PPP-PPP-</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Every regular (Plain Bob leadhead) method has the property
    that Middles and Wrongs are reverses of each other - that is,
    the number of leads from the start of the course to a Middle,
    is the same as the number of leads back (from the end of the
    course) to the Wrong. A bob Before will also always be in the
    middle of a course; naturally Home is at the end!</p>
    <p>Palindromic compositions happen, for one reason or another,
    to be very common and very useful. For this reason, SMC32
    provides [or will provide, in the next release!] a
    palindromic composing engine. It is a bit like the
    rotationally-sorted search, in that every palindrome found
    can be rotated to give all its variations. However, unlike
    the normal rotational search, not all touches are found -
    only palindromic ones.</p>
    <p>Given this, the palindromic search is an indispensable way
    of getting faster results from a big search. The palindromic
    touches found will often include the best of what is
    available; and the search speed, for palindromic one-parts,
    is comparable to a normal two-part search.</p>
    <h4>Call Counting</h4>
    <p>The more calling positions and types of call you have, the
    more branches there are in the search tree, and the longer it
    will take to complete the search. One way to restrict this is
    to specify limits on the number of calls in each position -
    for instance, by limiting the number of calls at I/V you can
    prevent SMC32 considering lots of short courses. See the <a
    href="smc32advanced.html#callcounting">Call Counting</a>
    section for more information.</p>
    <h4><a name="Evaluation and Output Performance">Evaluation and Output Performance</a></h4>
    <p>As well as raw composing speed, there
    are two other jobs SMC32 must do, which may sometimes impact
    on overall search speed. These are composition evaluation and
    output.</p>
    <p>If you have specified very weak music
    criteria (that is, low minimum scores), there may be huge
    numbers of compositions output to disk. Although SMC32 does
    buffer disk output, this will naturally slow the search
    substantially (apart from the obvious disadvantage of you
    having to wade through millions of touches in the output file!).
    By specifying the music you are looking for more tightly, you
    can speed composing by reducing disk output. Keep an eye on
    the MNodes/second figure - if this drops much below 1.0, you
    have a problem (or possibly a very slow PC). The 'Comps'
    figure tells you how many touches are being written to the
    output file. Even the analyser will take a reasonable time to
    process 100 000 compositions, so try and keep total search
    output below this.</p>
    <p>Of course, if there are lots of
    possible compositions in your search space, SMC32 will still
    have to spend time checking them all, to find the ones which
    pass the music tests. Remember it is checking all the
    rotations of every composition produced, too! You can see how
    many touches and rotations are being analysed by looking at
    the 'comps/s' figure. This will vary from moment to moment,
    but if it is consistently above the 50 000 comp/s level, it
    is likely SMC32 is spending a lot of its time just evaluating
    compositions, instead of finding them.</p>
    <p>One way to reduce this work is to
    narrow the composition length limits. For example, a search
    for touches 0-5200 will take very much longer than one in the
    range 5000-5100, simply because SMC32 can reject immediately
    any composition that is too short or too long. Unfortunately,
    for many methods (especially clean-proof ones) there are
    billions upon billion of possible peal-length touches. If you
    must find the best one, they've all got to be checked.</p>
    <p>Another factor to be borne in mind is
    the type of music definitions you have specified. Normally it
    does not matter how many different types of music there are -
    SMC32 combines all your definitions together when scoring
    compositions. However, if you have specified any music
    minimums, the evaluation routines must score and check them
    individually. This will reduce composing speed substantially
    if a lot of compositions are being produced.</p>
    <p>The moral is, for high-speed
    composition evaluation, use narrow length limits, and no
    music-definition minimums; use the overall minimum score
    instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Unresolved Issues">Unresolved Issues</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>There are some pitfalls caused by insufficiently capable
    behaviour in SMC32. I am hoping to resolve these if I can
    find (or someone can suggest) a suitable algorithmic solution.</p>
    <h4>Course-ends incompatible with the
    Rotationally-Sorted Search</h4>
    <p>It is possible to specify &quot;asymmetric&quot; course
    ends using the Callfrom instructions. An asymmetric set of
    course ends is one in which rotations of compositions won't
    obey the course-end restrictions; for example:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><code>Callfrom 0 1xxxxx7890 1674523890</code></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Here the rotational search cannot be used, because
    rotations of a matching composition are likely to contain any
    course end <code>1x7xxxx890</code>. Even
    worse, the rotational search will miss some compositions that
    do match the criteria. The only workaround at present is to
    manually set the <a href="index.html#Flags">noregen</a> flag.
    Note that there are still plenty of valid uses of the
    Callfrom instruction which are symmetrical, and will work
    with the rotational search; for example:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><code>Callfrom 7 1xxxxx7890 1xxxxx7089 1xxxxx7908</code></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <h4>&quot;Frozen&quot; Display</h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ocassionally the statistics display of the composing
    engine will freeze, often for very long periods of time. This
    occurs when SMC32 has reached a part of the search tree from
    which it is impossible to reach rounds - that is, all
    possible ways of coming round are false against the initial
    part of the composition. This affects the display, and more
    importantly the regular checkpointing of progress to the <code>.sf0</code>
	file, because for efficiency
    reasons SMC32 only drops out to the statistics routine when a
    composition is found that runs round.</p>
    <p>The current workaround is to leave SMC32 running long
    enough to escape from the &quot;frozen&quot; section,
    remembering you cannot restart during this period. I could
    improve this behaviour by forcing SMC32 to drop out of the
    composing loop more often (not just on rounds), but this
    would affect overall performance. What I am really looking
    for is an efficient way of <em>detecting</em> when the search
    has entered such a frozen area, and immediately backtracking
    out of it. This would be very beneficial to overall search
    speed, because no time would be wasted in areas of the search
    tree which cannot reach rounds. Anyone got any ideas?</p>
    <h4>&quot;Percentage Complete&quot; Inaccurate</h4>
    <p>Currently a very approximate method is used to estimate
    percentage complete in the rotationally-sorted search
    algorithm. It is useful as a measure of progress but does not
    represent time to completion very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <h4>Call-Counted Plain Leads sometimes don't work</h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>SMC32 processes <a href="#Nodes">nodes</a>, not leads. For
    example, in tenors-together Yorkshire Royal, one node can
    comprise 4 leads - from the Home to the Middle, or the Wrong
    to the Home. </p>
    <p>Naturally, bobs and singles always begin and end nodes,
    but not all plain leads do. Call counts on plain leads that
    are internal to a node will unfortunately be ignored. Taking
    the Yorkshire Royal example above, call counts on the second
    plain lead of a course (where the tenor is 7th's place bell)
    are ignored. A workaround is to put the count on the lead
    which ends the node instead, in this case where the tenor is
    Middle.</p>
    <p>It would be possible for SMC32 to break up sections of
    plain leads into smaller nodes if call counts have been
    placed on internal leads. However, this would affect
    composing speed, so a better solution would be automatic
    migration of the call count to the lead at the end of the
    node, perhaps with a warning message. I may implement this in
    a future version.</p>
