<h2><a name="Example Compositions">SMC32 Example Compositions</a></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>To show you the type of thing SMC32 is capable of
    producing, here are some example compositions that were
    generated during development and testing. All of these
    touches were superior (in terms of the music specified) to
    any comparable known composition. This doesn't always mean
    they are worth ringing - some of the pitfalls involved in
    musical analysis are pointed out.</p>

    <p>This is an example of the sort of quarter peal composition
    SMC32 can produce very easily - in this case, in just 7
    seconds. The criteria were: length 1280, bobs and singles,
    tenors together. For many Surprise methods (especially non-mx
    methods with substantial falseness) it is worth trying
    singles to get more music. (Of course, they are also useful
    to get snap finishes - with the <code>rounds
    internal</code> line - but these are usually musically
    poorer). For Dylan, singles increase the CRU count from the
    30 possible with bobs alone. However, this probably isn't the
    best composition to ring! There are better possibilities with
    more 5678s and more little-bell music.</p>

    <p>A search for quarter peals of Bristol with high numbers of
    56 and 65 rollups produced the touch above, after a 17-hour
    search. The run was lengthy, despite the low number of
    changes, because of the tenors-split calls that were allowed:
    all calling positions at a bob, and s3 and s5. The search
    time is very sensitive to the number of types of call and
    calling position - for example, adding s2 and s4 would leave
    you waiting many weeks! Tenors-split calls are also sometimes
    hard to predict: singles at 3 and 5 were specified in the
    expectation that the s3/s5 course would be useful; but in
    fact unusual 'negative' courses such as 5/s5, s3/4 and I/4/s3
    appeared far more often.</p>

    <p>This peal of Kent was the result of a tenors-together
    multipart search for peals in the range 5000-5200. It took 25
    hours to complete on a Cyrix 266. Kent is a difficult search
    space, again because it is an mx method and has relatively
    little falseness. However, in terms of CRUs, this improves on
    the previous best known multipart - a computer-generated
    3-part with 132 CRU. Of course, human ingenuity and
    palindromic searches have found normal-length one-parts with
    144 CRUs. Compositions with more interesting music are also
    easy to find.</p>

    <p>Here we have an interesting example of the use of SMC32 to
    refine an existing composition. It is based closely on David
    Hull's famous hand-produced &quot;Fluke&quot; peal, which
    contains similar music but fewer 2345/5432 runs on the back
    (36 instead of 48). SMC32 took 30 seconds to find the
    improved composition, using a tenors-together multipart
    search. Of course SMC32 did not 'know' of the existence of
    Hull's peal (except in that it had been given the same music
    criteria); but the result is so close a variation that it
    cannot be claimed as a new composition.</p>

    <p>A search of all tenors-together Yorkshire Maximus
    compositions from 5000 to 5100 changes using bobs, singles
    and the big Before, was completed in six days using an early
    version of SMC32. The peal above, nicknamed the Cosmic Joker,
    was one that nearly slipped through the net. It contains no
    courses called Home or Single Home, and therefore appeared in
    a later part of the search, after all possibilities using 3H,
    2H and sHsH had been exhausted. The unexpected appearance of
    a good composition so late in the search shows how important
    it is to let SMC32 run to completion. It also illustrates the
    danger of relying too heavily on music scoring, because on
    music counts alone there are better compositions - in fact,
    this one was only just above the minimum score. Because of
    this, it took a lot of work and not a little luck to find.
    Where the Joker really shines is in the distribution of
    music, with every full course containing both 56/65 rollups <em>and</em>
    little-bell music! It is quite unique, and its existence
    highly improbable.</p>
    <p>From the same search, the highest-scoring Yorkshire
    Maximus compositions all used blocks of Homes. The following
    more mundane offering answers the question, &quot;What is the
    maximum number of 56/65s possible in a normal peal length,
    given we must have both little-bell courses 35642 and
    24653?&quot;</p>
