<h2>New in Version 1.1</h2>
<span>Released: April 2019</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>Fixed: uninitialised flags (affecting different compilers / platforms).</li>
	<li>Fixed: flush stdout after status update.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Music paths now relative from .smc file.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Support for Linux.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: 64-bit support (using C++ implementation of compose loop).</li>
	<li>Enhancement: New flag, --deterministic-output to produce identical output regardless of platform.</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Reduce stdout refresh time on fast machines (now 5 per second rather than 2M iterations).</li>
	<li>Enhancement: Show final 100% stats before terminating compose loop.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
<span>Known issues:</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>No support for palindromic in 64-bit.</li>
	<li>Palindromic produces false compositions.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.965</h2>
<span>Released: November 2005</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>Fixed long-standing bug preventing analysis of compositions with non-default calling bell
	    and calling positions. (Default calling position names were not being reset).</li>
	<li>Better messages for analyser "invalid composition" errors.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.963</h2>
<span>Released: June 2004</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>Various bugs to do with linkage searches have been resolved - mostly to do with
		boundary cases such as MUSTHAVE/SHOULDHAVE blocks ending in rounds or containing
		snap finishes.</li>
	<li>Some analyser bugs found and fixed where composition length was calculated incorrectly,
		and the composition file rejected.</li>
	<li>Note that this version is still not exhaustively tested - I need someone to carry out
		regression tests for me, as well as check out the new linkage-search functions fully.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.962</h2>
<span>Released: November 2003</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>Music checking for negative rows DID NOT WORK! This has now been fixed,
		so that negative rows are counted properly, in both music and exclusions.</li>
	<li>Compositions entered by hand into .sf files were not checked for length.
		The analyser will now protest if you give the wrong length for a touch.</li>
	<li>Starting and finishing range for the percentage complete statistic has been
		made slightly more accurate (also prevents "nan" output when using a musthave
		block from rounds).</li>
	<li>Previously all 6-bell searches were forced into "non-course-structured" mode,
		i.e. any calls in any calling position allowed, regardless of your .smc file.
		This has been corrected (actually in 0.961) so that restricted calling positions
		can be specified exactly as for higher numbers.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.96</h2>
<span>Released: 22nd October 2003</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>"Linkage" searches can now be made, with the new MUSTHAVE/SHOULDHAVE directives.
	This allows the composer to specify blocks which must be included in the composition.
	The search engine will then try and link the given blocks. See this
	 <a href="smc32advanced.html#musthave">new section</a> for more
    information.</li>
	<li>A corresponding addition to analyser output to identify
	which MUSTHAVE/SHOULDHAVE blocks have been included in each composition.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.95</h2>
<span>Released: 16th May 2003</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>A new (optional) method of checking truth using a bitwise truthtable has been
	implemented. It is particularly useful for very false searches.
	See this <a href="smc32advanced.html#bittruth">new section</a> for more
    information.</li>
	<li>Maximum line length in .smc files has been increased from 1000 characters
	to 10K. This allows for very long music and exclusion lines.</li>
	<li>If a false composition is entered manually into a .sfx file, the analyser
	now prints the node-heads which are false against each other.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.94</h2>
<span>Released: 23rd January 2003</span>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>Starting and finishing rows other than rounds may now be specified.
	See this <a href="smc32advanced.html#NonRounds">new section</a> for more
    information.</li>
	<li>There was a bug in the analyser composition output which occasionally caused
	course ends to be omitted and the calling layout to be corrupted. This has
	been fixed.</li>
	<li>A minor change made to the inner composing loop to improve performance for
	searches in false methods that often bump up against the length limits.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.91</h2>
<blockquote>
	A crash bug has been fixed in the call-counted multipart search.
  Previously this search would crash out immediately if it tried to backtrack
  through a node in which&nbsp;a call type was not possible.
</blockquote>

<H2>New in Version 0.90</H2>
<span>Released: 8th June 2000</span>
<blockquote>
    <p><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Important Note</em></span>:
    Changes have been made to the way split tenors searches and
    searches with disallowed plain leads are specified. You may
    have to amend older <code>.smc</code>
    files that use these features. See below for more information.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Analyser composition output now prints the
    course-ends in the left column, and the calling in the right. This may be
    selectable in a future version.
        <li>Call counting - the composing engine can now limit
            the number of calls used, and the number of calls in
            each position. See this <A
            href="smc32advanced.html#callcounting">new section</a> for more
    information.
        <li>"Plain" definition changed - now uses the
            Call Counting syntax to disallow plain leads. Most
            importantly, positions not specified are <em>allowed</em>
            rather than prevented as before. See <A
            href="smc32advanced.html#disallowingplains">this
            section</a> for
    more information.
        <li>"Splittenors" flag removed. You can now
            specify two types of split-tenors search - course-structured,
            using e.g. "Callfrom 8 1xxxxxx8", and non
            course-structured, using "Callfrom -". Only
            the latter overrides your specified calling positions.
            See <A href="smc32advanced.html#splittenors">this
            section</a> for
    more information.
        <li>Bug fix: completely split-tenors searches, where all
            calling positions are allowed as well as split-tenors
            course ends, were incorrectly being processed as
            "course-structured" searches, leading to <strong>incorrect
            results!</strong> The analyser output
    for non-course-structured compositions has also been improved.
        <li>Bug fix: an initialisation error occasionally
    caused the table builder to report 0 non-excluded nodes, and hence terminate
    with "ERROR Rounds cannot be reached".
        <li>Bug fix: the analyser incorrectly displayed a warning
            message "Incorrect score 0 - should be <em>n</em>" when analysing human-generated compositions
    with the author given instead of score.
        <li>Bug fix: the default calls for non-mx 8th's place
    Major methods did not include Home.
        <li>Documentation improved - in particular, better
            explanation of potentially dangerous "pitfalls"
            caused by poor behaviour by SMC32 in certain
            circumstances. See <A
            href="smc32tech.html#Unresolved Issues">Unresolved
            Issues</a>.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.89</h2>
<span>Released: 2nd December 1999</span>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>"Splittenors" flag now honours any calling
    positions specified. So, you can allow split-tenors course ends but still
    restrict the calling positions for the calling bell. However, if no calling
    positions are given explicitly for a call, the default with "splittenors"
    will still be to allow all positions.
        <li>With a multi-part search it was previously the case
            that short compositions of fewer parts than the
            minimum could be found. These are now no longer
            output.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.88</h2>
<span>Released: 7th November 1998</span>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Prototype palindromic search: add the 'palindromic'
    flag to your input file. At the moment, only searches from the Plain Home
    apex - in particular, this is only applicable to 2nd's place methods.
        <li>Improvements to Analyser. Rotations of each
    composition are now treated separately (like the 'allrots' flag during
    composing); this means you might find the same composition more than once in
    the output file, in different rotations. Useful because the music in a
    rotation can be substantially different.
        <li>Improvements to Analyser composition output.
            Bracketted course-ends now shown where possible.
            "Special selection" compositions added to
            the end of the output file - each of these is optimal
            for just one musicdef.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.83</h2>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Improvements to Analyser composition output. If a
    calling position (such as Single Thirds) is reachable by a Single from a
    different lead than a Bob (e.g. Before), a separate column for the Single is
    printed, using the Single's own calling-position name.
        <li>'+' and '-' characters can now be appended to row
    matches in music files, to match only positive or negative rows.
        <li>Further bug fixes and improvements to analyser's
            composition column layout.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.82</h2>
<span>Released: 15th October 1998</span>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Bug fixes: "negative minimum" limits on undesirable
    music now work properly; non-PB leadhead methods now take 4th's place calls
    by default; multiparts of within one change of maximum length now found
    properly.
        <li>Wrap counting - see the <A href="index.html#Music">Music</a> section.
        <li>Music definitions can now be specified directly in
    the method file. Use "music" with no include filename, then list the music
    definitions in the usual format below.
        <li>If you do use a music include-file, the "minimum
    number of changes" fields can be overridden in the method file. After the
    "music &lt;music-file&gt;", add lines in the format
    "&lt;minimum-number-of-changes&gt; &lt;music-def name&gt;". Any minimums you
    specify in the method file replace those in the music file.
        <li>Composition evaluation speed has been improved
    dramatically, especially when no music minimums are used.
        <li>The calling bell can be changed from the tenor, and
    different course ends can be specified.
        <li>The 'splittenors' flag has changed function. It now
            automatically allows all calling positions and all
            course ends.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.80</h2>
<span>Released: 30th September 1998</span>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Fast table build. A better
            algorithm and improved memory structures have reduced
            slow table build times substantially. For example,
            London No.3 with singles and I/V builds in 2 seconds
            as opposed to 15. SMC32 can also cope with larger
            search spaces - e.g. tenors-split Royal - provided
            you have enough RAM. As soon as real memory is
            exhausted, and virtual memory needed, both building
            and searching times will worsen dramatically due to
            disk thrashing.
        <li>Better music counting:
            backstrokes/handstrokes, leadheads, handbell
            positions. See the end of the Music section.
        <li>Analysing 'human' compositions.
            It is possible to use the analyser mode with non-SMC32
            generated compositions - see the <A
            href="index.html#Analysing non-SMC32 compositions">Analysis</a>
			section. Basically you add the
            composition to a suitable search file, with the 'score'
            field replaced by the composer's surname.
        <li>Linkage-pruned search, using
            fragment library. Apparently working, but not
            verified. No documentation yet.
        <li>Bug fix in composition input (i.e. for restart and
            analysis).</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>New in Version 0.77</h2>
<span>Released: 22nd September 1998</span>

<blockquote>
    <p>As far as I can remember, the
    following improvements have been made since the last Beta.
    Most are documented later in this user guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="color:#ff0000">File handling has COMPLETELY
            changed</span>! Method input files MUST have
            extension <code>.smc</code>. Music
            input files MUST have extension <code>.mus</code>. Search-result files
            have extension <code>.sf0</code>,
            where '0' is automatically incremented from 1 up to 9,
            every time a new search is started.
			<span style="color:#ff0000">You should rename files from the
            earlier versions!</span>
        <li>Music files are no longer specified on the command
            line (except when performing 'off-line' analysis on
            search files - see (3) below). Instead, a 'music &lt;music-file&gt;'
            line is used in the <code>.smc</code> input file. This MUST be
    the last active line in the file.
        <li>There is a new analysis function. A new music file
            can be applied to a (complete <em>or</em> incomplete)
    search file, to generate a 'top ten' sorted list of best compositions, in
    human-readable form.
        <li>More statistics are displayed during composing,
    including a comps/s rate which gives the number of compositions (including
    rotations) produced and analysed per second. Time taken is now displayed in
    hours, minutes, seconds; and % complete has been made slightly more
    accurate.
        <li>The search-file output format has changed slightly.
    The number of parts in each composition is now listed, and only the calling
    for the first part given.
        <li>Several bugs have been fixed in: search restarting,
    'rounds internal' searches, memory handling and use of extremes.
        <li>Searches using tenors-split call combinations, such
    as I/V, V/4 etc. have been speeded up substantially. If a 'useless'
    tenors-split call is specified (such as I on its own) this is automatically
    ignored, with no impact on composing performance.
        <li>There is a prototype fragment-library generator. A
            new (undocumented) 'makelib n' input line will cause
            a <code>.lf0</code> fragment
            library file to be generated (where the 0 will be
            replaced with the same number as the search file). 'N'
            is the number of compositions to hold in memory to
            perform fragment comparisons on - this should be as
            large as possible. The default is 10000. Too big a
            number will exhaust 'real' memory, causing disk
            thrashing and loss of performance. No music file is
            needed for a fragment build search, but the minimum
            composition length should be set to 0, and the
            maximum length should probably not be set beyond six
            courses for best results. Current maximum fragment
            length is 32 nodes. <span style="color:#ff0000">N.B.</span>
            During library building, compositions are not saved
            to the search file!</li>
    </ol>
